					<h2>My Story</h2>
					<p>
						Since 2021, I have been attending Weber State University pursuing
						two degrees. The first is in Computer Science with a minor in Web
						Development and the second is Computational Statistics and Data
						Science. I held a role as a Web Developer for Weber State from May
						2022 - February 2024. I helped create two websites using the Wix
						Content Management System with some Javascript programming mixed in
						to work with APIs and the DOM. During the summer of 2024, I will
						take on the role of a Quality Assurance Engineer where I will gain
						many practical skills in testing, automation, reporting and
						teamwork. After the internship has ended, I will return to Weber
						State in the fall where I will continue my studies.
