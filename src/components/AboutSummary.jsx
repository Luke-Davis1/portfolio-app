				<p>
					Since 2021, I have been attending Weber State University pursuing two
					degrees. The first is in Computer Science with a minor in Web
					Development and the second is Computational Statistics and Data
					Science.
				</p>
				<p>
					I held a role as a Web Developer for Weber State from May 2022 -
					February 2024. I helped create two websites using the Wix Content
					Management System with some Javascript programming mixed in to work
					with APIs and the DOM.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the summer of 2024, I will take on the role of a Quality
					Assurance Engineer where I will gain many practical skills in testing,
					automation, reporting and teamwork. After the internship has ended, i
					will return to Weber State in the fall where I will continue my
					studies.
